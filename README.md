**Comments:**

<p align="justify">Another great project from the course, as we were required to build pretty much everything using mainly CSS & JS, with minimal tampering on the HTML portion <b>(mainly for the addition of link & script tags, as well as a single div tag in the body)</b>. One of the main focuses of this project is to also expose us to the concept of modules and packages, whereby I have come to appreciate how efficient and organize it is to break down all of our many functions into different files instead of writing them all in a single script.js file from the start till the end. Once all of my files were ready, I was able to use this wonderful thing called <b>Webpack</b>, which is a module bundler, that allowed me to essentially 'bundle up' all of my css & js codes into a single main.js file, to be distributed as my final product. Along the way, I have also learned how to use npm when setting up a new project to manage my project's dependencies & dev-dependencies with the help of some npm commands, how package.json file works, how to setup for webpack.config.js file, bla bla bla... Oh, and I got to mess around with the content of my restaurant page, you know, to make it a little fun for me and hopefully, for anyone who is going to see it as well~ üòÅ After all, I did spent quite a bit of time on this part, but mostly on re-learning and experimenting various effects with my rusty CSS skills. üò¨ With all being said, is time to move on to the next one! üí™</p>
